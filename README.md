# Front End Test

A React focused test for web developers

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
1. Complete this exercise
1. Submit the code either by mail or a link to a new repo

## Requirements
* Create a react app showing the weather for London.
* Use the included `weather.json` as the datasource (example from https://open-meteo.com)
* Things to show
  * Current weather state text description (ie. "Clear sky")
  * Current temperature
* Allow the user to toggle more data
  * Current wind direction
  * Current wind speed
* Have the next few days' weather state, temperature and other parameters listed, with a visual indication of whether the temperature is up or down from the day before.

## Bonus
Use live data (ie. from https://open-meteo.com/en/docs#api-documentation) to show the actual weather for a location given by the user.

## Evaluation
The code will be evaluated according to the following criteria
* That the code works correctly and performs the task described in this text.
* That the code is easily maintainable, i.e. easy to read and understand, and can easily be
 adopted to use in a large program.
* That the implementation is efficient and scales well when given large amounts of input data.

## Hint
* Refer to https://open-meteo.com/en/docs#api-documentation for how to interpret the `weather code` field.
* You can use `npx create-react-app` to get started.
* How do you test the code/app?
